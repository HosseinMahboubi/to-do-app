# to_do_app

Simple To-Do App

- A to-do app using Flutter packages

- In this project, I've used the staggered_animations package for animations.

- shared_preferences package for reading and writing simple key-value pairs.

- Lottie package for rendering After Effects animations natively.

- and finally the dart:convert package for converting between different data representations (encode & decode JSON files).

- The application logo is the same as Flutter (the Flutter Default Logo); it will be changed in the future.

- Here are some screenshots of the project; hope you guys enjoy it, and may the force be with YOU!.
